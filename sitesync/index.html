    <h1>SiteSync</h1>
    <p>Modernising construction site management in real time.</p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>

    <p>Poor communication, safety risks, lost productivity and lack of real-time oversight of assets
        cost construction companies millions per year.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>SiteSync brings daily logs, safety tracking, productivity monitoring, asset tracking and streamlined communcation in one real-time system accessible from any device.
